### About me
I am a aspiring Full Stack Software Developer or Data analyst.

### Career
I started my career in hospitality, fascinated by the opportunity in the industry. But after years of studies and hard work as pastry chef, I decided to see what else was out there for me. 
And that's when I discovered the world of coding. The idea of being able to "talk" to the cumputer I found it so satisfing, so much that coding became my "Happy place".
My passion for coding grew more and more but I lost my confidence when I was unable to find a coding job oportunity. So I worked in Sales and andmin so gain experience in the cooporate world. Now I am ready to take the next challenge.
